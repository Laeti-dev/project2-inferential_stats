This project concludes Matrice session on inferencial statistics.
The goal is to take a data set, using descriptive statistics then find a question to answer through inferencial statistics.
On this poject, I decided to work on health related Data set.  For this three days project, I worked on a data set from American National Center for Health Statistics.
This survey regards Anxiety and Depression symptoms occured during COVID-19 in the USA.
The survey was made online during 20 minutes, showing the percentage of adults who report symptoms of anxiety or depression that have been shown to be associated with diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder or major depressive disorder.  
These symptoms generally occur more than half the days or nearly every day.
I focused my sudy on depression.

Steps :

1- Analyse the Data set

2- Create columns for year and month of the survey for easier access

3- Analyse depression repartition in America according states through 2020 to 2022

4- Analyse depression depending on the gender

5- Analyse evolution during COVID-19
